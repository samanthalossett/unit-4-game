            <div class="rules"></div>
                <p>Play the game! Here's how...<br></br>
                        There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. <br></br>
                        You will be shown a random number at the start of the game. <br></br>
                        When you click on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to your total score. <br></br>
                        The game will hide this amount until you clicks a crystal.<br></br>
                        When you do click one, your score updates in the score counter.<br></br>
                        You win if your total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.<br></br>
                        You lose if your score goes above the random number.<br></br>
                        The game restarts whenever you win or lose.<br></br>
                        When the game begins again, you should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, your score (and score counter) will reset to zero.<br></br>
                        Eventually, you'll see the number of games that you win or lose. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.<br></br>
